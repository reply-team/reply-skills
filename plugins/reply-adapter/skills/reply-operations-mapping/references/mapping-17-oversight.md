*The organisation around the work* · 32 operations, 32 with an entry · contract 2.0.0 · adapter `reply`

**Reading the table.** † marks a core operation. *Reach* and *approval* are the
contract's own classification, reproduced here unchanged: knowing which endpoint performs an
operation alters neither what it is nor what it needs approved, and the two columns are present so
a reader can see for themselves that the mapping changed nothing. *Fulfilment* is this adapter's
claim — `direct` (one surface performs it), `composed` (several calls in the stated order),
`partial` (performed, but not to the contract's full promise, with the unkept part named) or
`absent` (not performable here today, with the evidence). *Surface* names an endpoint group and a
documentation page, never a path: the path, its parameters and its body come from that page at call
time. An operation shown as *not assessed* has no entry at all — nobody has answered for it yet,
which is a different statement from `absent`.

| Operation | Reach | Approval | Fulfilment | Surface | Scopes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `approval.request` | `control` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* No documented surface puts an item into a queue for a human. The pending-approval endpoints list, read, send, reject and regenerate items that are already there — the AI SDR sequence generates them itself under the approval mode set on that sequence, and nothing else can be queued for review. |
| `approval.list` † | `read` | `auto` | `partial`<br>*documented Beta or Coming soon* | ai-sdr-pending-approvals -> List pending approvals | `ai-sdr:read` | *missing:* Only AI-generated messages inside an AI SDR sequence reach this queue, on email and LinkedIn. A bulk write, a piece of content or a policy change waiting on a human has no queue here at all, so an empty queue does not mean nothing is waiting.<br>Each item carries when it was created rather than how long it has waited — the age the operation reports is computed from that. The queue can be filtered by sequence and by user. |
| `approval.get` | `read` | `auto` | `partial`<br>*documented Beta or Coming soon* | ai-sdr-pending-approvals -> Get pending approval for a contact | `ai-sdr:read` | *missing:* The item is addressed by contact rather than by an approval identifier, and only an AI-generated message is retrievable this way. Anything else a human is being asked to approve has no item to fetch. |
| `approval.resolve` † | `act`<br>*conditional:* `act` on approve, `control` on reject. | `confirm_each`<br>*conditional:* confirm_each on approve, confirm_once on reject — and the resolution is the confirmation when a human performs it directly. | `partial`<br>*documented Beta or Coming soon* | ai-sdr-pending-approvals -> Send a pending approval, Send a batch of pending approvals, Reject (delete) a pending approval | `ai-sdr:write` | *missing:* Rejection records no reason and is heavier than the contract's reject: it discards the queued draft and removes the contact from the sequence, with nothing documented to bring either back. Tell the user that before they reject, and keep the reason wherever the run is recorded.<br>Approving is the send, exactly as the contract has it, so the approval class is unchanged by the mapping — one named recipient is confirm_each, and the batch send is confirm_once over a preview that names the population. |
| `autonomy.get` | `read` | `auto` | `partial`<br>*documented Beta or Coming soon* | ai-sdr-sequences -> Read AI SDR sequence settings | `ai-sdr:read` | *missing:* One AI SDR sequence's own settings — whether its generated messages need approval, and whether autopilot is on. Nothing states what a credential may do unattended across the account, and there is no queue timeout, unattended action cap or escalation target to read. Everywhere else, autonomy is the agent's own policy held outside this product. |
| `autonomy.set` | `control` | `confirm_once` | `partial`<br>*documented Beta or Coming soon* | ai-sdr-sequences -> Set the approval mode, Enable autopilot, Disable autopilot | `ai-sdr:operate` | *missing:* The gate and the mode, on one AI SDR sequence. The queue timeout and what a timeout means, the unattended action cap, the escalation target and per-channel differences have no setting here.<br>Turning the gate off can also release everything already waiting, in the same call. That makes loosening the gate a send, not a settings change, and it must be previewed and approved as one. |
| `escalation.raise` | `control` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `escalation.list` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `escalation.resolve` | `control` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `editorial_review.record` | `control` | `confirm_once` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface binds a named human's review to a sent message. A message approved out of the AI SDR queue records that it was sent, which is not the same fact and must never be reported as one. |
| `editorial_review.get` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — nothing records the review, so nothing can return it. The honest answer to an auditor here is that no review evidence exists in this product. |
| `review.request` | `control` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `review.list` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `review.get` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `review.score` | `control` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `feedback.record` | `control` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `review_policy.define` | `control` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `review_policy.get` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `scorecard.define` | `control` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `scorecard.list` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `scorecard.publish` | `control` | `confirm_once` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `scorecard.retire` | `control` | `confirm_once` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `coaching.summarize` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — the reporting surfaces cover activity and performance, not coaching. Nothing records that someone attended, listened, commented, scored or gave feedback, so there is nothing to summarise per coach. |
| `budget.get` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface reports what is left on a meter. A meter does exist: starting a Live Data search spends the user's data allowance. That the remaining allowance cannot be read is exactly why a search is previewed before it is started. |
| `budget.set` | `control` | `confirm_once` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — checked against the endpoint index, nothing sets an allowance ceiling of the kind a pre-flight check reads. |
| `stoprule.set` | `control` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `stoprule.list` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `stoprule.clear` | `control` | `confirm_once` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `stoprule_firing.list` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — nothing stops the work by itself here, so there are no firings to list. When sending is off in this product it was a person or an agent that stopped it, and the reason lives in the run record rather than in the API. |
| `stoprule_firing.get` | `read` | `auto` | `absent` | — | — | *because:* not evidenced — no documented surface was found for this |
| `outreach.hold` † | `control` | `auto` | `partial` | contact-blacklist-rules -> Create an email blacklist rule, Create a domain blacklist rule, Bulk create email blacklist rules, Bulk create domain blacklist rules | `contacts:write` | *missing:* This blocks future contact and nothing else. Live enrolments, scheduled steps, open tasks, pending approvals and outstanding meeting proposals are untouched by it, and the rule returns no per-item ledger of who was actually reached. The kill switch the contract describes is only realised once those are stopped too, through their own operations, and every one of them has to be reported.<br>A person is held by an email rule and a company or a domain by a domain rule. Rules are account-wide, so check the existing rules before adding one and expect the block to apply to work other people own. |
| `outreach.release` | `control` | `confirm_once` | `partial` | contact-blacklist-rules -> Delete an email blacklist rule, Delete a domain blacklist rule, List email blacklist rules, List domain blacklist rules | `contacts:write`, `contacts:read` | *missing:* Deleting the rule lifts the block, but nothing resumes by itself: whatever was stopped when the hold went on has to be restarted deliberately, and no ledger of what was held exists to restart it from. Re-check each person's eligibility first — the contract requires it and this product will not. |

The contract's own classification of these operations — the full five properties, the check before repeating, the invariants they enforce — is in `catalog-17-oversight.md`, in the `sdr-operations` skill. What this adapter does not reach, and why, is collected in [fulfilment.md](fulfilment.md).
