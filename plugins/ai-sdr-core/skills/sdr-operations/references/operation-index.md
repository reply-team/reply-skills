- `campaign.list` † — "What is running?" — every campaign with its state and health: fine, not progressing, degraded, blocked.
- `campaign.get` † — "Show me this campaign" — settings, senders, schedule and timezone policy, pacing, reply policy, declared successor, and the count of people in each state.
- `campaign.create` — "Start a new campaign" — always a draft; creating never sends and never arms anything.
- `campaign.clone` — "Build this one from the one that worked" — structure, steps, variants, schedule, pacing and reply policy; never enrolments, history or results.
- `campaign.update` — "Change the campaign's own settings" — name, owner, description, personalisation tier, declared successor, and the exit rules that are not reply events.
- `reply_policy.set` — "What happens when they answer?" — one decision per event class, plus the window inside which a reply is still attributed to this campaign.
- `schedule.set` — "When may this campaign send?" — windows per day, timezone policy with its ordered fallback, delay basis, out-of-window behaviour, attached blackout calendars.
- `pacing.set` — "Slow this campaign without slowing everything else on the same mailbox" — people admitted per day and messages sent per day, plus minimum gap, jitter and cold-start ramp.
- `sender_binding.set` — "Send this from these mailboxes, numbers or social accounts" — for a campaign or for named participations.
- `campaign.validate` — "Is this safe to turn on?" — missing or unpublished content, steps no sender can serve, a schedule that never opens, no terminal condition, the count already enrolled, projected first-24-hour volume, projected metered cost, whether the test send passed, and any successor campaign.
- `campaign.test` — "Let me receive step 1 myself, and click the unsubscribe link, before two hundred strangers do" — only to addresses the workspace can demonstrate it owns.
- `campaign.activate` — "Turn it on"
- `campaign.pause` † — "Stop this campaign" — incident response: never requires a lookup first and never waits for permission.
- `campaign.resume` — "Start it sending again" — refuses unless it is actually paused.
- `campaign.freeze` — "Suspend it over the holidays, the conference, the incident" — carries a mandatory expiry and resumes itself.

- `campaign.unarchive` — "Bring it back into the working set" — never resumes sending.

*The programme* · [catalog-06-steps.md](catalog-06-steps.md)

- `step.list` — "What does this campaign actually send, in what order, and which steps owe a human?"
- `step.add` — "Add a step" — channel, execution mode, kind, position, delay with unit and basis, optional declared intent, personalisation mode and budget, content binding, threading, and for a branch its condition, evaluation window and early-satisfaction behaviour.
- `step.update` — "Change a step" — delay, content binding, intent, personalisation, threading, branch condition, or whether it is enabled at all.
- `step.remove` — "Delete a step" — destroys its variants and their measurement history and can advance everyone waiting on it sooner than they expected.
- `step.reorder` — "Put the new step at position 2" — moves steps without delete-and-re-add, so variants, template bindings and history survive.
- `variant.add` — "Try a second version of this step's copy", optionally with a split share — an unsettable split is reported, never silently assumed to be even.
- `variant.update` — "Change a variant's content, its split share, or whether it is enabled"
- `variant.remove` — "Delete this version" — destroys its measurement history, so a variant under test is disabled rather than removed.
- `variant.list` — "What versions of this step exist, which are enabled, and at what share?"
- `template.create` — "Save this copy so other campaigns can use it" — creates the template and its first draft version; a draft cannot be sent.
- `template.update` — "Change the copy" — always produces a new draft version, never mutates a published one.
- `template.get` — "Show me this template" — the content of each version, which version is published, when each was published or retired, and which live campaigns bind each version.
- `template.list` — "What content do we have, and what state is it in?"
- `template.publish` — "Make this version sendable" — a published version is immutable.
- `template.retire` — "Stop anyone using this version" — refused while live campaigns bind it unless a replacement is named; history stays readable.
- `content_policy.define` — "State a rule our copy must obey" — never mention pricing, always carry the identification block, never claim a customer by name, never use a competitor's trademark — each with its scope and whether a breach blocks or warns.
- `content_policy.list` — "Which content rules apply here, and which of them block rather than warn?"
- `content_policy.check` — "Does this draft break any of them?" — takes a rendered message and returns the rules that fired, where, and whether each blocks or warns.

- `enrollment.get` — "Where is this person in this campaign?" — state, position, why it is not progressing, exit reason, business outcome, the sending identity behind it, and when the next touch is due.
- `enrollment.pause` † — "Hold this person here" — with a reason and an optional dated automatic resume.
- `enrollment.resume` — "Let them carry on" — refuses unless the participation is actually held.
- `enrollment.stop` † — "Take them out, and record why" — the reason is mandatory and must be able to name a different person as the cause.
- `disposition.set` — "What came of this participation?" — the business outcome, from the account's declared vocabulary, distinct from any reply's intent and from the execution state.
